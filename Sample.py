'''Go through each node, check left, check right, check if currnt sum is equal to the target sum. If yes, then add into the global res, c
an do the same with path, or set path to new list while passing it to helper again, so that the path goes in as a reference and not as a value.
Or pop last element of path when left and right recursion is done, and add path to res as a new list so that it goes again by value and not by reference. 
Cz a datastructure inside a datastructure is a reference'''
